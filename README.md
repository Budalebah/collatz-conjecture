# Hylé Example RISC Zero smart contract

This repository provides an example smart contract for Hylé, implementing the Collatz Conjecture.

## Installing RISC Zero

## Running the smart contract

```bash
cargo run next X # Proof the transition from X to the next number in the collatz conjecture
```

```bash
cargo run reset X # Reset to X if the current number is a 1
```
